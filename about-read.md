# Understanding the Project
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the ***attendance*** with in-time. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new employees, addition of photos to the training dataset, signing up, logging in, viewing attendance reports, etc. Alog with these it also has an extra ***security system*** in it. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually with added security. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

_This web application is made for the purpose of face recognition login using ReactJS as a frontend and Python Flask and opencv as a backend. Hence make sure that you have reactjs as well as python flask and opencv configured on your machine in order to run this application._
